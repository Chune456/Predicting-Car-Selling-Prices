### Predicting Car Selling Prices

A beginner level data science project that explores and builds a model to predict used-car selling prices using regression techniques.
This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementation of a linear regression model

### Project Overview

I have created a workflow that:
        - Imports and cleans the data.
        - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA).
        - Builds a regression model (linear regression) to predict car selling price.
        - Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

### Motivation

I was learning to apply theory of regression in a practical scenario, to preprocess real-world data and extract insights. I also wanted to understand how to build a predictive models
